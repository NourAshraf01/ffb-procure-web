# FFB Procure - Frontend Documentation

## Overview

**FFB Procure** is a Flutter web application that was initially built using FlutterFlow and then exported to Flutter code, with some modifications for improved readability and functionality. The app uses Supabase as its database provider and includes a variety of custom components and widgets. FlutterFlow employs the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to effectively separate concerns between data logic and user interface (UI). For each component, youâ€™ll find a model file responsible for managing data states and business logic, and a widget file dedicated to rendering the UI and reflecting any updates to the data state.
